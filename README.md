**Summary of Uber Fare Prediction Project**
Objective:
The project aimed to develop a predictive model for estimating Uber fares based on various factors, enhancing the pricing strategy and operational efficiency of ride-sharing services.

Approach:

Data Collection:

The dataset used comprised approximately 200,000 Uber rides in New York City from 2009 to 2015, sourced from Kaggle.
Key data points included fare amount, date and time of ride, pickup and dropoff coordinates, and the number of passengers.
Driving distances were calculated using the Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) API.
Data Processing:

Generated features from date and time, such as year, month, day of the week, and time of day.
Addressed the correlation between fare and distance, ensuring accurate feature extraction and analysis.
Explanatory Analysis:

Conducted statistical analyses including ANOVA to determine significant differences in fares across years, months, days, and times of the day.
Examined internal dependencies between features, identifying a high linear correlation (r = 0.9) between distance and fare.
Modeling and Assessment:

Employed various regression techniques, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.
Explored ensemble models, combining linear and random forest models.
Evaluated models based on R-squared scores, with the random forest model achieving the highest R-squared score of 85.6%.
Data Insights:

Significant Correlations: Distance showed a high correlation with fare, as expected, while other temporal features (year, month, day, time) also significantly influenced fare amounts.
Model Performance: The best-performing model was the random forest regression with an R-squared score of 85.6%. Ensemble models combining linear and random forest regressions also performed well, suggesting the benefits of leveraging multiple algorithms.
Residual Analysis: The model's residuals were not randomly distributed, indicating some underlying patterns not captured by the model. This pointed to potential improvements through re-assessment of data patterns or separate models for short and long-distance rides.
